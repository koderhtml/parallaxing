# Parallaxing
### A jQuery plugin for creating parallax backgrounds.

## Demo

## Download
Get the [minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koderhtml/parallaxing/master/parallaxing.min.js) version or the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koderhtml/parallaxing/master/parallaxing.js) here.

## How to use? 
Start by including this plugin after jQuery. Then use data-atributtes to load parallaxing efect to your element.

``` html
<div style="height:150px;width:100%;" data-parallaxing="" data-parallaxing-img="paralax.jpg"></div>

```

As you can see above you need to set data-parallaxing="" and data-parallaxing-img="paralax.jpg" and that is all. But to make it little bit better you can use more attributes.

All available attributes:
* `data-parallaxing`
* `data-parallaxing-img`
* `data-parallaxing-speed`
* `data-parallaxing-bleed`
